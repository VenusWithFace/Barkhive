Some archive of HTML/Browser games because why not.
Disclaimer: I'd like to mention that these were NOT MADE TO BE PLAYABLE ON SCHOOL COMPUTERS. If you choose to use this on school computers that is your fault and not mine. You've been warned.
Another thing: I want to credit the original repository that I've used as a base for this repo. The original was the HU-Archive by Quite-A_Fancy_Emerald. I used the games from that but also added onto it.
